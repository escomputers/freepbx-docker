#include sip_general_additional.conf

;sip_general_custom.conf is the proper file location for placing any sip general 
;options that you might need set. For example: enable and force the sip jitterbuffer. 
;If these settings are desired they should be set the sip_general_custom.conf file.
;
; jbenable=yes
; jbforce=yes
;
;It is also the proper place to add the lines needed for sip nat'ing when going
;through a firewall.  For nat'ing you'd need to add the following lines: 
; nat=yes , externip= , localhost= , and optionally fromdomain= .
;
#include sip_general_custom.conf

;sip_nat.conf is here for legacy support reasons and for those that upgrade 
;from previous versions.  If you have this file with lines in it please make
;sure they are not duplicated in sip_general_custom.conf, if so remove them 
;from sip_nat.conf as sip_general_custom.conf will have precedence.
#include sip_nat.conf

;sip_registrations_custom.conf is for any customizations you might need to do to
;the automatically generated registrations that FreePBX makes.
;
#include sip_registrations_custom.conf
#include sip_registrations.conf

; These files should all be expected to come after the [general] context
;
#include sip_custom.conf
#include sip_additional.conf

;sip_custom_post.conf If you have extra parameters that are needed for a 
;extension to work to for example, those go here.  So you have extension 
;1000 defined in your system you start by creating a line [1000](+) in this 
;file.  Then on the next line add the extra parameter that is needed.  
;When the sip.conf is loaded it will append your additions to the end of 
;that extension.
