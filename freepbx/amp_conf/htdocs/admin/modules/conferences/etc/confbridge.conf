; confbridge_custom.conf:
; This file can be used to add user configurations. Examples might include adding manual
; settings to the [default_user] and [default_bridge] sections that FreePBX does not
; currently generate and for FreePBX 2.10 there is currently no plan to be able to
; configure those settings. It should be noted that the dialplan does use the dialplan
; CONFBRIDGE() function to configure various settings which will override anything
; explicitly set here and thus needs to be configured in the GUI, but settings not
; controlled in the GUI can be added here and should apply.
